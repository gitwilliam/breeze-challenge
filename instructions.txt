Breeze,

I appreciate the fun chat with Janet the other day and the opportunity to attempt a solution to this coding exercise.

I have not used Laravel or React in a professional capacity.  It took me longer than I had hoped, and there is still 
more that I would have liked to do; but I told my wife I would finish it this evening.

   * The React application needs unit testing.
   * The API application needs additional unit testing/api testing.
   * Additional file input validation and reporting to the user is needed.
   * A progress bar would be really nice for the uploading, even I got nervous sometimes.
   * And it needs to be more responsive (i.e. popping data in the tables as it is loaded).


Instructions to the end-user:

To import a People CSV and Groups CSV file into the Breeze Church Management,

1) Format the People CSV file in the following way,
first_name,last_name,email_address,status,group_id
Mary,Brandybuck,mary@theshire.net,active,4
Samwise,Gamgee,samwise@theshire.net,active,5
Bilbo,Baggins,billbo@theshire.net,active,5
Frodo,Baggins,frodo@theshire.net,active,6
Gandalf,Wizard,gandlaf@theshire.net,archived,6

2) Format the Groups CSV file in the following way,
id,group_name
4,Staff
5,Elders
6,Choir

3) Upload both files one at a time by 
   3a) Selecting the "Choose File" button, 
   3b) Selecting the file of choice, 
   3c) And then selecting "Upload"

4) The table on top will update with all the People in the system (Active and Archived)
5) The tabbed table on the bottom will display a tab for each Group.  Each tabs contains a table with all Active members of the Group.
